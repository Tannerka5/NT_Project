                        <p>
                            One of the biggest efforts that Christ had during his ministry was his acts of service for 
                            others. To accomplish the outcome of lifelong learning and service, I decided that I would 
                            look for specifically seek out service opportunities around me. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From small things like doing my roommate's dishes or helping my friends with their homework to bigger 
                            things like helping a coworker and her family move to a new apartment, I have been specifically seeking 
                            for opportunities to serve others. I have also been trying to be more aware of the needs of those around 
                            me. This second part has been a little more difficult as I have always been a little forgetful that 
                            everyone has their own trials in their lives that are unknown to me, but exercising that skill, just 
                            like exercising a muscle, has been able to make it stronger.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The best part about serving others is that it is a win-win situation. I am able to help others with 
                            their problems and doing so also helps to make me feel better and feel closer to Christ. Jesus 
                            Christ was the ultimate example of service and I have definitely felt closer to him by better serving my 
                            those around me.
